1. Separate CSS file used for styling 

2. The overflow property specifies whether to clip the content or to add scrollbars when the content of an element is too big to fit in the specified area.
The overflow property has the following values:

Each list item usually rendered with a bullet (in unordered lists, defined by the <ul> tag) or a number or letter 
(in the case of ordered lists, defined by the <ol> tag). The appearance of bullet or the number can be controlled with the type attribute.

global attributes. The <span> tag is used for specifying a section in a document.
