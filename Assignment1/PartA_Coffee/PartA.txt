Part A of the assignment is on web page of Coffee Shop:
Below are the major tags used in the assignment


1. Favicon: It is a small image displayed on the left of the page title in the browser table.
It can be created on site like https://www.favicon.cc 

2. Table: Web developers can organize data into rows and columns using HTML tables.
Each table cell is defined by a <td> and a </td> tag  	  td-table data
Each table row starts with a <tr> and ends with a </tr> tag   tr-table row
For table heading starts with <th> and ends with </th> tag    th-table headers

3. Form: To gather user input, an HTML form is utilized. Most frequently, a server processes the user input.
Text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons, and other types of input elements are all contained within the "form" element.

4. Images: An image can be embedded in a web page using the HTML img> tag.
Images are linked to web pages; they are not technically inserted into web pages. The referenced image is held in place by the img> tag.

The img> tag has no closing tag, is empty, and only contains attributes.

The img> tag must have the following two attributes:

src - Defines the image's path.
alt - Defines a different caption for the image

5. Hyperlink: Hyperlinks in HTML are links.

A link can be clicked to open a different document.

The mouse arrow transforms into a tiny hand when you hover the cursor over a link.
The important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.

6. Button: The <button> tag defines a clickable button.
We can specify the attribute for a <button> element.
