I have created a webpage showing the places to visit and food to explore in a city called Portland in Maine. 

	The home page consists of a header with a logo in it and section named "Things to do" div where two hyperlinks are given which will take us into 	another pages. 

	In "Places to Visit" page, I have used different images to show the places a tourist can visit and a description for each image. I have also used 	videos and a audio tags.

	In "Food to Explore" page, I have used images and description t suggest food places.


TAGS USED:

1. Favicon - Favicon is added to the webpage using <link> tag where the relationship is mentioned as "icon".

2. <header> - This element is used to represent a container for introductory content or set of navigational links. In <header> I have just included the logo.

3. Hyperlink - With the hyperlinks, one can click and jump to another document or another web page. When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse will turn into a little hand. The hyperlinks need not only be texts, they can be images or any html element as well. I have used this hyperlinks to navigate from home page to "Places to Visit" and "Food to Explore" pages.

4. Images - Images can improve the design and appearance of the web page. I have added a many images wherever required.

5. <audio> - The Audio tag is used to embed sound content in a document, such as music or other audio streams. It contains one or more <source> tags with different audio sources. The browser will choose the first source it supports. There are three supported audio formats in HTML: MP3, WAV and OGG.

6. <video> - This tag is used to embed video content in a document, such as a movie clip or other video streams. It contains one or more <source> tags with different audio sources. The browser will choose the first source it supports. There are three supported audio formats in HTML: MP3, WebM and OGG.

7. <details> - It is used to give additional details that the user can open and close on demand. It is often used to create an interactive widget that the user can open and close.

8. <mark> - This tag defines the text that should be marked or highlighted.

9. <footer> - This tag defines a footer for a document. I have given the social media links in the footer.

10. <h1> -- <h6> - These tags are used to define HTML headings.

11. <br> - This tag inserts a single line break. It has no end tag.

12. <p> - This tag defines a paragraph.

13. <div> - This tag defines a division or section in an HTML document.

14. Variables: Variables are a way to store information that you can re-use later.
	In this assignment I have used variable to give color in background/to text and style to the font.


15. Custom Properties: Property names that are prefixed with --
represent custom properties that contain a value that can be used in other declarations using the 
var() function.
In this assignment I have used custom propery to give the background colour to the header part of the page.

16. Nesting: SASS Nesting makes our work very efficient, we donâ€™t have to repeat outer selectors again and again.
We can write nested selectors in the order they appear in the HTML file (i.e., Parent-Outer and Child-Inner Selector form ). 
In this assignment nesting is used in style.scss.


17. Placeholder Selectors(Inheritance): 
In this assignment I have used inheritance to hover over the images with differnt color in _button.sass file 

18. Mixins: The @mixin directive lets you create CSS code that is to be reused throughout the website.
Used in _config file to define and @include in _visit to give border to images.

19. Functions:
In this assignment functions are used to change the text colour based on background colour.
