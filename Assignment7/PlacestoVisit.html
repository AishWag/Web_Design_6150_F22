            <p><strong>Portland Head Light</strong></p>
            <p>Lighthouses are not only a literal landmark for boats, they have become an iconic symbol of Maine and are
                local landmarks for most coastal towns. Portland is no exception, home to several lighthouses that date
                back as far as 1871.

                One of the most visited is Portland Head Light in Cape Elizabeth thanks to its excellent museum and
                stunning views of Casco Bay and Portland Harbor, as well as four additional area lighthouses.</p>

        <div class="image">
            <img src="images/fall.jpg" alt="Multnomah Falls" style="width:100%;height:400px;">
            <p><strong>Multnomah Falls</strong></p>
            <p>At 620 feet (189 m), Multnomah Falls is the tallest waterfall in Oregon. The dramatic two-tiered falls
                are fed by underground springs from Larch Mountain, and the flow over the falls varies, usually at its
                highest during winter and spring.
                There are many scenic hiking routes nearby, and Multnomah Falls is one of the best places in the
                Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area to study geology exposed by floods

            <p><strong>Crescent Beach</strong></p>
            <p>Part of Crescent Beach State Park, just south of the city on Cape Elizabeth, the mile-long Crescent Beach
                is surrounded by dunes and woodlands with its share of Maine's iconic rock-bound shoreline. Boardwalks
                lead to the beach through dunes covered in sea grass, giving the beach a secluded feel, while offshore,
                fishing boats bob in the water around a small island.</p>

    <p>Very few travellers go to this place as the rest don't know much about this place. But trust me this is an
        absolute heaven in portland. Head out to this place during the sunset time. There'll be a shuttle boat which
        costs you very minimal amount and leaves you with a memorable sunset ride.</p>
